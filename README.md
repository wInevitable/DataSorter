# Data Sorter

Parse and sort your text files easily with Ruby!

### Instructions

* To have the Data Sorter do your dirty work for you:
	* Instantiate a new DataSorter object, passing in any number of cumbersome text files as command line arguments in the process.
	* Call your preferred sort on the DataSorter object (i.e. data_sorter.gender_sort).
	* Sit back, relax, and watch as your previously obtuse and unorderly text data is magically sorted right before your eyes!'
	* Remember to save any output for reference at a later point in time.
* Optional RSpec tests are included:
	* Run these with 'rspec spec/data_sorter_spec.rb' from the root directory.
